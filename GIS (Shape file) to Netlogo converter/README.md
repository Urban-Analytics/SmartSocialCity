## GIS to Netlogo converter
### Allows the user to import shape files into netlogo to create agent-based models on large spatial environments.
The netlogo template is `BRiton.nlogo`


The line of code to be replaced is the directory of the '.shp' file which is:


`set map-view gis:load-dataset "data/United_Kingdom/infuse_dist_lyr_2011.shp"`


Your `shape` file should be added in a file of your choosing in the root directory `data/<YOUR DIRECTORY>`
